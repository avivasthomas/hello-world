# hello-world
This is my first repository! I am still figuring out how GitHub works. I will store ideas, resources, and share and discuss things with others here.


Testing... Testing...
My name is Andreina. Three years ago, during my last summer before college, I discovered Codeacademy.com and dove into the basics of Web Development with HTML and CSS. (That landed my first internship. Yay!) I, then, learned Python and C++ during my Freshman year. I took a Data Structures & Algorithms class my Sophomore year and Introduction to Databases (MySQL, and a bit of PHP and Javascript) my Junior year. So that's my background on coding. I am currently a Teaching Assistant at Girls Who Code, where I teach Scratch, Python, HTML/CSS and Arduino to 20 high school girls in 7 weeks.
